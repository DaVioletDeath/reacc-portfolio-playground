            <p> I'm an up and coming programmer born in New Jersey and raised in Tennessee.
                My mom was a software engineer for a government based firm and having been around programming and coding all my life, i started to become really interested in it and wanted
                to learn more about it. So currently i am going through a coding boot camp hosted by Vanderbilt to learn more and while it's kicking my ass, I do feel like my knowledge is 
                slowly growing and I am definitely becoming more and more interested in coding.
