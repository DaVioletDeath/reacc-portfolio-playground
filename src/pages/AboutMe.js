            <p> I'm an up and coming programmer born in New Jersey and raised in Tennessee.
                My mom was a software engineer for a government based firm and having been around programming and coding all my life, i started to become really interested in it and wanted
                to learn more about it. I recently graduated from the full stack flex web development boot camp hosted by Vanderbilt University and am still honing my coding skills.
